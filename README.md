Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) - README
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web-based application designed to streamline the submission, review, and approval process for monthly claims by Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. The system provides a simple, user-friendly platform for IC lecturers to submit claims for work performed within a specific time period, upload any supporting documents (e.g., timesheets, receipts), and track the status of their claims in real time. The aim of CMCS is to reduce administrative burdens, enhance transparency, and ensure the smooth handling of monthly payments.
Key Features
CMCS offers a variety of features that cater to the needs of Independent Contractor lecturers, Programme Coordinators, and Academic Managers. Lecturers can quickly submit claims, check their status, and be notified of any approval or rejection updates. Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers play crucial roles in reviewing and approving claims, ensuring that the workflow is transparent and efficient. The system also supports document management, allowing users to attach important files, which are securely stored and easily accessible when needed.
Technology Stack
The CMCS is built using the .NET framework, leveraging .NET Core for backend development and MVC (Model View Controller) architecture to separate the logic, user interface, and data management. SQL Server is used as the database engine, ensuring robust storage and retrieval of claim-related data. The front-end interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the user interface intuitive and easy to navigate.
Setup Instructions
To get started with CMCS, ensure that you have .NET Core installed, along with SQL Server for database management. The system can be deployed on any server that supports .NET applications. To configure the system, you’ll need to update the database connection string in the configuration file to match your server setup, ensuring proper access to the SQL Server instance where the CMCS database is hosted. After setting up the database, you can create the necessary tables and begin using the application by launching it through your preferred development environment or deploying it to a production server.
Usage Instructions
Once set up, users can log into the system using their provided credentials. Independent Contractor lecturers can navigate to the "Submit Claim" page to fill out claim details, upload documents, and submit them for approval. Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can review submitted claims, approve or reject them, and leave comments for clarification if necessary. Notifications will be sent to all relevant parties, ensuring smooth communication and tracking of claims.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the system, ensure that the SQL Server is correctly configured and that remote connections are enabled if the system is hosted on a separate server. Also, verify that the connection string in the application configuration matches your SQL Server instance. In case of connectivity issues, check your firewall settings to allow traffic on SQL Server’s default port (1433) or the port you have specified. Detailed error logs can be found in the application logs or SQL Server logs, which can help identify and troubleshoot any issues.
Future Enhancements
While the current version of CMCS focuses on core functionality, future updates may include enhanced reporting features, integration with payroll systems, and the ability to generate summaries or exports of claims in various formats (e.g., PDF or CSV). Additional authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication, may also be implemented to improve security.
